# DNS Tool — Authoritative Sources Registry

> **Purpose**: Canonical reference of every standards body, regulatory authority, RFC, and data source this project relies on. Every claim in code, templates, documentation, and UI copy must trace back to an entry here. If a source isn't listed, we don't cite it. If it's listed as "draft" or "proprietary," we label it as such — never as a ratified standard.

> **Rule**: Before implementing any feature that references a standard, verify its current status at the authoritative URL listed below. Drafts change. RFCs get obsoleted. Assumptions rot. Check first.

## 3. Quality Gate Authorities

These are not standards bodies but tool vendors whose metrics we treat as mandatory quality gates.

| Authority | Tool | Our Target | URL |
|-----------|------|------------|-----|
| Google | Lighthouse | Performance 100, Best Practices 100, Accessibility 100, SEO 100 | https://pagespeed.web.dev |
| Mozilla | Observatory | Score 130+ (never decrease) | https://observatory.mozilla.org |
| SonarSource | SonarCloud | Reliability A, Security A, Maintainability A | https://sonarcloud.io |

**Rule**: These scores are checked during development, not after. A regression in any gate blocks the change.

## 5. Non-Standard / Proprietary Directives We Track

These are NOT ratified standards. We detect them as intelligence but never claim they are standards.

| Directive | Origin | Status | Our Position |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Content-Usage | IETF aipref WG | Active draft (draft-ietf-aipref-attach) | Detect and report on scanned domains. Do NOT use in our own robots.txt until ratified. |
| Content-Signal | Cloudflare | Proprietary (contentsignals.org) | Not currently detected. Monitor for ecosystem adoption. |
| llms.txt | llmstxt.org | Community convention (NOT RFC 8615) | We serve it; our scanner detects it. Not an IETF standard — it's a community spec. |
| security.txt | IETF | RFC 9116 (Standards Track) | We detect it. This IS a ratified standard. |

## 6. Verification Checklist — Before Citing Any Source

1. **Is it ratified?** Check https://datatracker.ietf.org for RFC status. "Internet-Draft" or "Active WG Draft" means NOT ratified.
2. **Has it been obsoleted?** Check the "Obsoleted by" field on datatracker. Citing an obsoleted RFC is embarrassing.
3. **Is it the right RFC?** RFC 8615 defines .well-known/ mechanics — it does NOT define llms.txt. RFC 9309 defines robots.txt parsing — it does NOT define Content-Usage.
4. **Is it proprietary?** If it's from a single vendor (Cloudflare, Google, etc.) and not an IETF/W3C standard, label it "proprietary" or "vendor-specific."
5. **Do we use observation language?** "Detected," "observed," "present" — never "compliant" or "validated" unless we actually validate against the full spec.

---

## 7. Update Protocol

- **When adding a new feature**: Check if the underlying standard is listed here. If not, add it with current status.
- **Every quarter**: Spot-check draft statuses on datatracker. Drafts expire, get adopted, or die.
- **After any Lighthouse/Observatory/SonarCloud regression**: Trace the regression to its root cause and document in EVOLUTION.md "Gotchas" section.
- **Before citing any RFC in UI copy**: Verify it on datatracker. Do not trust cached memory.
