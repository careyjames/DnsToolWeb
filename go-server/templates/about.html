                    <p class="mb-2">DNS Tool exists because of a simple reality: when something breaks, someone has to prove what happened.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2 text-muted">Across 25+ years in IT and security, the pattern repeated itself &mdash; something goes down, executives want answers, and the explanation had better come with verifiable facts. A graphic designer edits the website and breaks DNS. A vendor change cascades into a mail outage. Every time, it was either going to be your fault for no reason, or you found the real cause and proved it.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0 text-muted">That pressure &mdash; needing to pull up RFCs, run dig commands, craft one-liners, and produce evidence under fire &mdash; is why this tool exists. After doing that hundreds of times, the obvious question became: <em>why isn&rsquo;t there a tool that just does this automatically?</em></p>

Not just the hardware &mdash; the community. They didn&rsquo;t punish bad questions. They didn&rsquo;t gatekeep. They taught.

OMG cables, Bash Bunnies, and the hands-on offensive security work that teaches you to think like an adversary. Understanding attack vectors changes how you evaluate defenses &mdash; you stop accepting &ldquo;it&rsquo;s probably fine&rdquo; and start demanding proof.</p>
                    <p class="mb-1 text-muted small">High-profile clients &mdash; the kind who needed to understand lockdown mode, why their credentials leaked, and how an attacker could walk into their office with a cable that looks like a charger &mdash; needed live demonstrations, not slide decks. The offensive tools made those demonstrations possible and turned abstract threats into something tangible.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0 text-muted small">That work led to a <a href="https://payloadhub.com/blogs/payloads/mac_exfil?_pos=1&_sid=53d35434c&_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">Hak5 Payload Award</a> for an exfiltration payload (mac_exfil). A different discipline entirely, but part of the same path &mdash; understanding how systems actually work, not how they&rsquo;re supposed to work.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0 text-muted">The earliest version of this tool was a Python CLI &mdash; a terminal app that pulled back DNS results in one quick scroll. Out in the field doing DMARC audits for clients, the alternative was running a dozen dig commands and crafting one-liners. The CLI was basic &mdash; no RFC citations, no intelligence analysis &mdash; but it was the seed: type a domain, get an honest answer about what&rsquo;s actually configured.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0 text-muted">That CLI became what you see now &mdash; a Go-powered intelligence platform that queries five independent DNS resolvers for consensus, cryptographically hashes every analysis with SHA-3-512, cites the RFC for every finding, and produces reports that would hold up at a DEF CON presentation or a board meeting. The reports are the r&eacute;sum&eacute;.</p>
