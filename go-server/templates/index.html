                    "text": "This is one of the most common misconceptions in email security. SPF -all (hard fail) sounds stronger, but RFC 7489 Section 10.1 warns that it can cause receiving servers to reject messages before DKIM is checked and before DMARC can evaluate the result. A message that would pass DMARC via DKIM alignment gets rejected prematurely. Google and most major providers recommend ~all (soft fail) for active sending domains, with DMARC p=reject as the enforcement layer. The combination of ~all + DMARC reject is the strongest compatible security stance — every authentication method is fully evaluated before a disposition decision is made. Federal .gov context: CISA BOD 18-01 (2017) requires valid SPF records and DMARC p=reject for federal civilian agencies. The directive doesn't explicitly specify -all vs ~all, but federal agencies widely adopted -all as a defense-in-depth practice. In 2017, most federal domains had no DMARC at all, so -all was a pragmatic safety net — you couldn't rely on DMARC being there. Now that DMARC p=reject is in place, the -all is somewhat redundant and creates the RFC 7489 §10.1 risk, but federal infrastructure is controlled enough that the risk is lower. The directive hasn't been updated to reflect the industry consensus around ~all + DMARC reject. Microsoft also historically defaults to -all."

It does not instruct receivers to block spoofed emails. Similarly, p=quarantine instructs receivers to treat suspicious messages as spam, where recipients might still open them. DMARC p=reject instructs receiving servers to refuse messages that fail authentication (RFC 7489, Section 6.3) — they should never reach the inbox or spam folder. The recommended modern configuration is SPF ~all (soft fail) combined with DMARC p=reject and verified DKIM signing. This configuration ensures every authentication method is fully evaluated before a disposition decision is made."

The Netherlands adopted DANE early and aggressively — SIDN (the .nl registry) promoted it and the Dutch government mandated it, creating the false impression DANE was only a Dutch phenomenon. Making things worse, DANE for web browsers genuinely failed (Let's Encrypt solved HTTPS differently), so people conflated 'DANE for websites is dead' with 'DANE is dead' — missing that DANE for email (SMTP, RFC 7672) was thriving separately. What actually happened: over 4 million domains now publish TLSA records globally (per stats.dnssec-tools.org). Microsoft Exchange Online announced GA of inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in October 2024, available to all tenants at no extra cost. Outbound DANE has been live since March 2022. The IETF itself uses DANE on mail.ietf.org. Adoption extends beyond the Netherlands: Sweden, Norway, Czech Republic, and EU public agencies all deploy it. Most security audit tools still skip DANE because it requires DNSSEC (RFC 7672 §1.3) and was historically complex to check, creating a self-reinforcing blind spot. DNS Tool breaks that cycle by checking DANE/TLSA for every MX host alongside MTA-STS. Best practice: deploy both DANE (cryptographic strength) and MTA-STS (broader compatibility)."

                    "text": "DANE (RFC 7672) is the primary standard for securing email transport. It publishes TLS certificate information in DNSSEC-signed DNS records (TLSA), creating a cryptographic chain of trust from the DNS root to the mail server certificate — removing reliance on certificate authorities. MTA-STS (RFC 8461) was created as an alternative for domains where 'deploying DNSSEC is undesirable or impractical' (RFC 8461 §2). It publishes a TLS policy via HTTPS using the web PKI trust model. RFC 8461 establishes a clear hierarchy: senders 'MUST NOT allow MTA-STS validation to override a failing DANE validation.' Both mechanisms coexist because DANE is backward-compatible — sending servers skip the DANE check if the receiving domain isn't DNSSEC-signed (RFC 7672 §1.3). Microsoft Exchange Online enforces inbound DANE with DNSSEC (GA October 2024), and Proton Mail and Fastmail also support DANE. Google Workspace does not support DANE — its shared MX infrastructure does not publish TLSA records — so it relies on MTA-STS instead. Best practice is deploying both for defense in depth: DANE provides the strongest cryptographic controls via DNSSEC, while MTA-STS provides coverage for senders that don't validate DNSSEC."

                                A domain security audit examines your domain's DNS configuration, email authentication records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), transport security (DANE/TLSA certificate pinning, MTA-STS, TLS-RPT), encryption settings (DNSSEC), certificate controls (CAA), and email security management providers. It examines your domain's observable DNS controls for email spoofing, DNS hijacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, and brand impersonation — and whether configuration detected signals consistent with active management or is left unmonitored. DNS Tool performs all these checks in a single scan and delivers a security posture assessment based on controls observed.

                                DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) adds cryptographic signatures to DNS responses, designed to detect tampering in transit. Without DNSSEC, attackers could redirect your domain's traffic to malicious servers through DNS hijacking or cache poisoning. DNS Tool validates the full DNSSEC chain of trust and checks the AD (Authenticated Data) flag across multiple resolvers. Many enterprise organizations use alternative security measures like enterprise-grade DNS providers with built-in DDoS protection when DNSSEC is not deployed.

                                <strong>DANE</strong> (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities) pins TLS certificates to DNS via TLSA records, providing controls against man-in-the-middle attacks and rogue CAs when DNSSEC is deployed — over 4 million domains publish TLSA records globally (per <a href="https://stats.dnssec-tools.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">stats.dnssec-tools.org</a>), including Microsoft Exchange Online. <strong>BIMI</strong> (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) enables brand logo display next to emails in supporting inboxes, providing a visual signal consistent with authenticated sending. <strong>MTA-STS</strong> (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) instructs sending servers to require encrypted email delivery, providing controls against downgrade attacks. <strong>TLS-RPT</strong> (TLS Reporting) sends delivery failure reports when encrypted email connections fail, giving you visibility into transport security issues. <strong>CAA</strong> (Certificate Authority Authorization) specifies which certificate authorities are permitted to issue certificates for your domain. CAs now verify CAA from multiple geographic locations via MPIC (Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration, mandatory since September 2025 per CA/B Forum Ballot SC-067). DNS Tool analyzes your CAA records and provides context on MPIC implications. These are advanced security controls that complement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. DNS Tool checks all of them in a single scan.

                                This is one of the most common misconceptions in email security. SPF <strong>-all</strong> (hard fail) sounds stronger, but <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489#section-10.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">RFC 7489 §10.1</a> warns that it can cause receiving servers to reject messages <em>before</em> DKIM is checked and <em>before</em> DMARC can evaluate the result. A message that would pass DMARC via DKIM alignment gets rejected prematurely. Google and most major providers recommend <strong>~all</strong> (soft fail) for active sending domains, with <strong>DMARC p=reject</strong> as the enforcement layer. The combination of <strong>~all + DMARC reject</strong> is the strongest compatible security stance — every authentication method is fully evaluated before a disposition decision is made.
                                <br><br><strong>Federal .gov context:</strong> <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-18-01-enhance-email-and-web-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">CISA BOD 18-01</a> (2017) requires valid SPF records and DMARC p=reject for federal civilian agencies. The directive doesn't explicitly specify -all vs ~all, but federal agencies widely adopted -all as a defense-in-depth practice. In 2017, most federal domains had no DMARC at all, so -all was a pragmatic safety net — you couldn't rely on DMARC being there to catch what SPF missed. Now that DMARC p=reject is in place across federal domains, the -all is somewhat redundant and creates the RFC 7489 §10.1 risk, but federal infrastructure is controlled enough that the risk is lower. The directive hasn't been updated to reflect the broader industry consensus around ~all + DMARC reject. Microsoft also historically defaults to -all.

                                This is a simple way to remember that <strong>DMARC p=none</strong> is only a monitoring policy — it instructs receiving servers to deliver everything, even messages that fail authentication, and just send reports. It does not instruct receivers to block spoofed emails. Similarly, <strong>p=quarantine</strong> instructs receivers to treat suspicious messages as spam, where recipients might still open them. <strong>DMARC p=reject</strong> instructs receiving servers to refuse messages that fail authentication (RFC 7489, Section 6.3) — they should never reach the inbox or spam folder. The recommended modern configuration is <strong>SPF ~all</strong> (soft fail) combined with <strong>DMARC p=reject</strong> and verified <strong>DKIM</strong> signing. This configuration ensures every authentication method is fully evaluated before a disposition decision is made.

                                This is one of the most widespread misconceptions in email security, and it's easy to see why it took hold. The Netherlands adopted DANE early and aggressively &mdash; SIDN (the .nl registry) promoted it, and the Dutch government mandated it. That high visibility created the false impression DANE was <em>only</em> a Dutch phenomenon. Making things worse, <strong>DANE for web browsers genuinely did fail</strong> &mdash; browsers never adopted it because Let's Encrypt solved HTTPS certificate distribution differently. People conflated "DANE for websites is dead" with "DANE is dead," missing that <strong>DANE for email (SMTP) was thriving separately</strong> the entire time.
                                <br><br><strong>What actually happened:</strong> DANE for SMTP (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7672" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">RFC 7672</a>) quietly grew into a global standard. Over <strong>4 million domains</strong> now publish TLSA records (<a href="https://stats.dnssec-tools.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">stats.dnssec-tools.org</a> tracks daily). Adoption extends well beyond the Netherlands: Sweden (.se), Norway (.no), Czech Republic (.cz), and EU public agencies all have significant DANE deployment.
                                <br><br><strong>The turning point:</strong> <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/announcing-general-availability-of-inbound-smtp-dane-with-dnssec-for-exchange-on/4281292" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">Microsoft Exchange Online announced General Availability</a> of inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in October 2024 &mdash; available to <strong>all Exchange Online tenants at no extra cost</strong>. Outbound DANE has been live since March 2022. By Q4 2025, Microsoft plans to make outbound SMTP DANE mandatory per-tenant. The IETF itself uses DANE on <strong>mail.ietf.org</strong>. This isn't a niche experiment &mdash; it's the world's largest email platform betting on it.
                                <br><br><strong>Why most tools ignore DANE:</strong> DANE requires DNSSEC (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7672#section-1.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">RFC 7672 &sect;1.3</a>), and DNSSEC adoption was historically slow. Most security audit tools skipped DANE because checking it was complex and few domains had it. This created a self-reinforcing blind spot: if your tool doesn't check DANE, you never see it, so you assume nobody uses it. DNS Tool breaks that cycle.
                                <br><br><strong>Try it yourself</strong> &mdash; analyze these domains to see DANE in action: <a href="/analyze?domain=ietf.org" class="text-info">ietf.org</a> (the IETF's own infrastructure), <a href="/analyze?domain=nlnetlabs.nl" class="text-info">nlnetlabs.nl</a> (creators of the Unbound DNS resolver), <a href="/analyze?domain=freebsd.org" class="text-info">freebsd.org</a> (the FreeBSD project). DANE works alongside <strong>MTA-STS</strong> &mdash; best practice is to deploy both: DANE provides cryptographic strength via DNSSEC, while MTA-STS provides broader compatibility for receivers that don't validate DNSSEC.

                                The RFCs themselves establish a clear hierarchy. DANE is the primary standard; MTA-STS is the alternative for domains that cannot deploy DNSSEC.
                                <br><br><strong>DNSSEC + DANE</strong> (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7672" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">RFC 7672</a>) is the <strong>strongest mechanism</strong>. DANE publishes TLS certificate information in DNSSEC-signed TLSA records, creating a cryptographic chain of trust from the DNS root to the mail server certificate. This removes reliance on certificate authorities &mdash; no trust-on-first-use weakness, no vulnerability to CA compromise. The requirement: your domain must be signed with DNSSEC.
                                <br><br><strong>MTA-STS</strong> (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">RFC 8461</a>) was created for domains where <em>&ldquo;deploying DNSSEC is undesirable or impractical&rdquo;</em> (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461#section-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">&sect;2</a>). It publishes a TLS policy via HTTPS using the existing CA trust model. Simpler to deploy but inherits CA limitations and is vulnerable on first use (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461#section-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">&sect;10</a>). RFC 8461 mandates: senders <em>&ldquo;MUST NOT allow MTA-STS validation to override a failing DANE validation&rdquo;</em> &mdash; DANE always takes precedence.
                                <br><br><strong>Why both coexist:</strong> DANE is <strong>backward-compatible by design</strong>. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7672#section-1.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">RFC 7672 &sect;1.3</a> specifies that sending servers simply skip the DANE check if the receiving domain isn't DNSSEC-signed. This means enabling DANE never breaks anything &mdash; it only adds protection for senders that validate it. MTA-STS works independently alongside DANE without conflict.
                                <br><br><strong>Where the camps stand today:</strong>
                                <ul class="mb-2">
                                    <li><strong>Microsoft</strong> is the strongest DANE advocate. Exchange Online enforces inbound DANE with DNSSEC (<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/announcing-general-availability-of-inbound-smtp-dane-with-dnssec-for-exchange-on/4281292" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-info">GA October 2024</a>), and plans to make outbound DANE mandatory per-tenant. Microsoft also supports MTA-STS, but DANE is their strategic direction.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Proton Mail &amp; Fastmail</strong> fully support DANE with DNSSEC on their mail infrastructure, providing cryptographic transport controls for their users.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Google</strong> validates DANE outbound (Gmail checks TLSA records when sending to DANE-enabled domains). However, <code>google.com</code> is <strong>not DNSSEC-signed</strong>, and <strong>Google Workspace customers cannot deploy DANE</strong> &mdash; Google's shared multi-tenant MX infrastructure (<code>aspmx.l.google.com</code>) does not publish TLSA records and does not allow customers to do so. Google relies on MTA-STS for inbound transport security.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Apple</strong> uses MTA-STS for iCloud Mail. <code>apple.com</code> is not DNSSEC-signed and has no DANE/TLSA records.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Government agencies</strong> (Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Nordic countries) tend to mandate DANE+DNSSEC, often by policy. The <strong>IETF itself</strong> uses DANE on <code>mail.ietf.org</code>.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <strong>The key question:</strong> Microsoft's enforcement momentum is the most significant development. When the world's largest email platform not only supports but <em>enforces</em> DANE, it creates pressure on sending domains to enable DNSSEC so their DANE records are actually validated. If Microsoft makes outbound DANE mandatory &mdash; meaning Exchange Online <em>requires</em> DANE for delivery to domains that publish TLSA records &mdash; it could tip the balance toward universal DNSSEC+DANE adoption.
                                <br><br><strong>Best practice:</strong> Deploy both for defense in depth. DANE provides the strongest cryptographic controls via DNSSEC, while MTA-STS provides coverage for senders that don't validate DNSSEC. The German BSI TR-03108 standard mandates both DANE and MTA-STS together with TLS-RPT. The protocols are complementary: <strong>DANE for cryptographic strength, MTA-STS for breadth of coverage</strong>.
                                <br><br><strong>See it in practice:</strong> Analyze <a href="/analyze?domain=ietf.org" class="text-info">ietf.org</a> to see DANE + DNSSEC delivering the strongest transport security, then compare with <a href="/analyze?domain=google.com" class="text-info">google.com</a> which uses MTA-STS &mdash; the best available option given Google's infrastructure cannot support DNSSEC/DANE.

                                <strong>OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)</strong> is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources.

                                <br><br>DNS Tool is an OSINT platform. Every data source we query is publicly available: DNS records (via standard resolvers), certificate transparency logs, RDAP registrar data, and publicly accessible web resources. We do not bypass authentication, probe closed ports, or exploit vulnerabilities. We observe what is already visible to anyone with a browser or a <code>dig</code> command &mdash; and we organize those observations into <strong class="u-actionable-intel">actionable intelligence.</strong>
