Short answer: Google absolutely does DKIM.
What you’re seeing is a detection-model limitation, not Google missing DKIM.

Let’s untangle it cleanly.

⸻

What’s actually happening with google.com

Google does not publish DKIM at the apex (google.com) the way small domains do.
Instead, Google uses service-specific, rotating DKIM selectors on subdomains.

Examples (not exhaustive):
	•	20230601._domainkey.google.com
	•	20221208._domainkey.google.com
	•	google._domainkey.googlemail.com
	•	Workspace customer domains: selector1._domainkey.customer-domain

These selectors:
	•	rotate frequently
	•	are not predictable
	•	are not limited to google / selector1 / selector2

So when your tool says:

“No DKIM records found for common selectors”

That is technically true
but semantically misleading for hyperscalers.

⸻

Why Google does it this way (and why it’s smart)

1. Scale + rotation

Google sends mail for:
	•	google.com
	•	gmail.com
	•	googlemail.com
	•	thousands of internal and regional domains

Static selectors are a liability at that scale.

2. Separation of concerns
	•	SPF + DMARC + ARC handle policy & alignment
	•	DKIM is treated as a transport integrity primitive, not a branding signal
	•	Google leans heavily on DMARC enforcement (which you correctly detect as p=reject)

3. ARC (important!)

Google uses ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) extensively.

ARC allows DKIM to:
	•	survive forwarding
	•	survive mailing lists
	•	survive enterprise gateways

Most DNS tools don’t check ARC at all — but Google relies on it heavily.

⸻

Why your tool flags “Partially impersonatable”

This line in your UI is doing the damage:

Can this domain be impersonated by email? → Partially

From a strict DNS-only perspective, that’s defensible.

From a real-world mail security perspective, it’s misleading for Google-class domains.

Why?

Because:
	•	DMARC is p=reject
	•	SPF is valid
	•	MTA-STS + TLS-RPT are configured
	•	DKIM exists, just not discoverable via static selector guessing

In practice: you cannot spoof google.com mail successfully.

⸻

The fix (and this is important for your tool’s credibility)

1. Change DKIM detection states

Instead of:
	•	❌ Warning: No DKIM records found for common selectors

Use:

DKIM: Not discoverable via static selectors
Large providers use rotating or non-public DKIM selectors.

This preserves technical honesty without implying insecurity.

⸻

2. Adjust the impersonation verdict logic

Add a rule like:

If DMARC = reject
AND SPF valid
THEN Email impersonation = No
even if DKIM selectors are not discoverable

DKIM is important — but DMARC enforcement is the final authority.

Google knows this. RFCs agree with this.

⸻

The deeper truth (this is the real lesson)

DKIM is not a discovery problem — it’s a validation problem.

DNS tools try to discover DKIM.
Mail receivers try to validate DKIM during SMTP.

Those are fundamentally different operations.

Google optimizes for the second.

⸻

Bottom line
	•	❌ Google does not “skip DKIM”
	•	✅ Google uses rotating, non-static DKIM selectors
	•	✅ Your tool is detecting exactly what DNS exposes
	•	⚠️ Your wording currently over-interprets the absence of guessable selectors
	•	🔧 Small wording + logic tweaks will make your tool correct and fair to hyperscalers

If you want, next I can:
	•	help you special-case hyperscaler mail architectures
	•	define a DKIM detection confidence model
	•	or add an “Enterprise / Hyperscaler pattern detected” badge

But the short answer stands:

Google absolutely does DKIM — your tool just isn’t meant to see it this way.
