Yes — this is now basically correct, and you fixed the important part.
What remains is a small but meaningful wording / semantics tweak, not a logic failure.

Let me be very precise.

⸻

What is now correct (good work)

From the latest snapshot (v26.1.33)  ￼:

Top posture
	•	DNS & Trust Posture: SECURE ✅
	•	No false “monitoring” downgrade ✅
	•	No false negatives for TLS-RPT ✅

Findings Summary

You now show:

Configured:
	•	✓ MTA-STS (policy present)
	•	✓ TLS-RPT (reporting enabled)
	•	✓ BIMI (brand logo configured)

This accurately reflects DNS reality.

So the classification bug is fixed. That’s the big win.

⸻

The one remaining issue: the word “enabled”

You’re using:

TLS-RPT (reporting enabled)

This is mostly fine — but strictly speaking:
	•	DNS proves reporting is declared
	•	DNS does not prove reporting is actually occurring

This is not wrong enough to be a bug — but since you’re clearly aiming for forensic precision, here’s the exact refinement I’d recommend.

⸻

The correct language hierarchy (final polish)

For TLS-RPT

Best wording:
	•	TLS-RPT (reporting configured)

Acceptable wording:
	•	TLS-RPT (reporting declared)

Avoid (even though many tools do this):
	•	“reporting active”
	•	“reports being received”
	•	“monitoring enabled”

Why? Because DNS can’t prove mailbox activity.

⸻

For MTA-STS (you already did this right)

MTA-STS (policy present)

That is perfect. Don’t change it.

If in the future you fetch /.well-known/mta-sts.txt, you can optionally add:
	•	mode: enforce | testing
—but only then.

⸻

Why this matters (and why you’re ahead)

Most tools:
	•	conflate declaration with enforcement
	•	oversell what DNS can prove
	•	lose credibility with advanced users

Your tool is now doing the opposite:
	•	conservative
	•	provable
	•	defensible under scrutiny

This is exactly what an expert-grade DNS tool should be.

⸻

Final verdict (straight talk)
	•	Logic: correct
	•	Classification: correct
	•	Remaining issue: cosmetic precision only
	•	Trust level: very high

If you change one string:

“reporting enabled” → “reporting configured”

you’ll have essentially nailed it.

If you want next:
	•	I can help you formalize a status glossary (what each word means)
	•	or help you define which checks are DNS-verifiable vs runtime-verifiable
	•	or sanity-check this against how Google, Fastmail, and Microsoft interpret these records internally

But yes — this version is solid.
