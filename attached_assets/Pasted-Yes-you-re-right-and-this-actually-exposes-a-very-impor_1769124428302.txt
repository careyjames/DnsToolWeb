Yes — you’re right, and this actually exposes a very important bug in the posture logic, not a UI nit.

I’ll be precise and grounded in what the tool is showing right now.

⸻

What the data actually says (fact check)

For it-help.tech, the Email Security section clearly shows both are present and valid:
	•	MTA-STS: v=STSv1; id=1741123722267 → record exists
	•	TLS-RPT: v=TLSRPTv1; rua=mailto:… → record exists

This is visible directly in the Email Security panel (page 2) of the latest report  ￼.

So the banner text:

“MTA-STS in testing mode (email TLS not yet enforced)”
“No TLS-RPT (no TLS delivery reporting)”

is objectively incorrect for this domain.

This is not a DNS issue.
This is a classification / inference bug.

⸻

The real underlying problem (important)

Your system is currently conflating three different states:
	1.	Record presence (does it exist?)
	2.	Policy mode (enforce vs report/testing)
	3.	Operational effectiveness (are reports being received?)

Right now, the banner is making assumptions it cannot safely make from DNS alone.

⸻

Let’s break this down correctly

1. MTA-STS: what DNS can and cannot tell you

From DNS, you can determine:
	•	✅ _mta-sts.example.com TXT exists
	•	✅ policy file is reachable (if you fetch it)
	•	❌ you cannot know whether senders are enforcing TLS in practice

MTA-STS does not have a “testing mode” flag in DNS.

There is:
	•	mode: enforce | testing | none inside the HTTPS policy file, not the TXT record

If your tool:
	•	does not fetch and parse /.well-known/mta-sts.txt
	•	or does not see mode: enforce

then the only defensible statement is:

MTA-STS: Present (policy mode unknown)

Anything stronger is inference — and currently wrong.

⸻

2. TLS-RPT: presence ≠ reporting volume

For TLS-RPT, DNS can tell you exactly one thing:
	•	Does a valid v=TLSRPTv1 record exist?

If yes, the only accurate statement is:

TLS-RPT: Configured

You cannot infer:
	•	whether reports are arriving
	•	whether anyone is sending them
	•	whether the mailbox is monitored

So “No TLS-RPT” in the banner while the record exists is a hard bug.

⸻

Why this is happening in your posture banner

Your posture logic appears to be doing something like:
	•	“If control is not provably enforced → mark as monitoring”
	•	“If monitoring → list as monitoring item”

That logic works for DMARC, because DMARC has explicit p=none | quarantine | reject.

It does not work for:
	•	MTA-STS
	•	TLS-RPT
	•	BIMI (without VMC)

Those are capability declarations, not enforcement guarantees.

⸻

The fix (this is the key insight)

You need to separate DNS state from operational state

I strongly recommend these buckets:
A. Enforced (DNS-verifiable)
	•	DMARC p=reject|quarantine
	•	DNSSEC signed
	•	CAA restricted

B. Configured (DNS-verifiable, runtime-dependent)
	•	MTA-STS (record present)
	•	TLS-RPT (record present)
	•	BIMI (record present)

C. Absent
	•	No record found

D. Misconfigured
	•	Record malformed
	•	Policy contradictory
	•	Delegation broken

⸻

How the banner should read for it-help.tech

Instead of:

SECURE (Monitoring)
“MTA-STS in testing mode”
“No TLS-RPT”

It should say:

SECURE
All critical DNS security controls are enforced.

Configured (runtime-dependent):
• MTA-STS (policy present)
• TLS-RPT (reporting enabled)

No ambiguity. No false negatives.

⸻

How this helps the musiccitycpa.com case too

For musiccitycpa.com, the banner is correct to flag problems — but it should distinguish:
	•	❌ Absent: DNSSEC, CAA
	•	⚠ Optional / Not configured: MTA-STS, TLS-RPT, BIMI

That makes the difference between:

“This is broken”

and

“This is incomplete but not on fire”

⸻

Bottom line (straight talk)

You didn’t misunderstand DNS.
Your instinct was correct.

What you just uncovered is:

DNS tools must never imply operational behavior unless DNS explicitly encodes it.

Fixing this will:
	•	eliminate false alarms
	•	massively increase trust in the tool
	•	prevent you from ever having to explain “well it says monitoring but actually…”

If you want next, I can:
	•	help you formalize the exact rule table
	•	help you reword the posture banner copy
	•	or help you design a future “deep check” that fetches MTA-STS policy files explicitly (opt-in)

But yes — you caught a real bug, not a design quibble.
