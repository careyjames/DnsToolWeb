Yes — better, but you’re absolutely right: the TLS line is still wrong, and now we can be very precise about why.

This is no longer a “wording” issue. It’s a state-model bug.

I’ll anchor this in what your tool is literally showing for it-help.tech right now  ￼.

⸻

What the DNS data actually proves (no interpretation)

From the Email Security section (page 2):
	•	TLS-RPT record EXISTS

v=TLSRPTv1; rua=mailto:dc1e127b@inbox.ondmarc.com;


	•	Your UI even correctly labels it:
	•	“TLS-RPT configured – receiving TLS delivery reports”

So the DNS facts are unambiguous:

TLS-RPT is configured.

⸻

What the top banner currently says (incorrect)

At the top (page 1), under Findings Summary, you show:

Not Configured:
– TLS-RPT (TLS delivery reporting)

That is factually false based on DNS.

So your instinct is correct:
the TLS classification is wrong, even though the raw analysis is right.

⸻

Why this keeps happening (root cause)

Your posture logic is still doing this implicitly:

“If I can’t prove runtime behavior → treat as not configured”

That logic is valid for enforcement guarantees
It is not valid for capability declarations.

TLS-RPT is only a declaration mechanism. DNS cannot tell you:
	•	whether reports have arrived
	•	whether the mailbox is read
	•	whether senders honor it

But none of that affects whether it is configured.

⸻

The correct mental model (this fixes everything)

You need three distinct states, not two.

1. Absent

DNS record does not exist.

2. Present (DNS-verifiable)

DNS record exists and is syntactically valid.

3. Enforced / Active (policy-verifiable)

DNS explicitly encodes enforcement semantics.

Now map controls correctly:

Control	DNS can prove presence	DNS can prove enforcement
SPF	✅	❌
DKIM	✅	❌
DMARC	✅	✅ (p=)
MTA-STS	✅	❌ (needs HTTPS fetch)
TLS-RPT	✅	❌ (by design)
BIMI	✅	❌
DNSSEC	✅	✅
CAA	✅	✅


⸻

What your banner should say for it-help.tech

Current (wrong)

Not Configured:
– TLS-RPT

Correct

Configured (DNS-verified):
✓ MTA-STS
✓ TLS-RPT
✓ BIMI

Optionally:

Enforcement verified:
✓ DMARC (REJECT)
✓ DNSSEC
✓ CAA

This keeps you honest and unassailable.

⸻

Key wording rule (this prevents future bugs)

❌ Never say:
	•	“not configured”
	•	“monitoring only”
	•	“not enforced”

unless DNS explicitly encodes that state

✅ Say instead:
	•	Present
	•	Absent
	•	Enforced (policy-verified)
	•	Runtime-dependent (only if you want to be fancy)

⸻

Why this matters (hard truth)

If a domain owner sees:

“TLS-RPT not configured”

when it is configured, you lose trust immediately — especially with the kind of users this tool attracts.

You’re already doing the hard part (correct detection).
This is about classification discipline.

⸻

TL;DR
	•	You were right — TLS-RPT is being misclassified
	•	The fix is not UI, it’s state modeling
	•	Treat TLS-RPT as “Present / Absent” only
	•	Reserve “enforced” language for controls that encode enforcement in DNS

Once you make that change, this tool becomes extremely hard to argue with — in a good way.

If you want, next I can:
	•	help you formalize the exact enum values for each control
	•	sanity-check every banner sentence against “can DNS actually prove this?”
	•	or help you design an optional deep-inspection mode that fetches HTTPS policies separately

But yes — you caught it again, and you’re correct.
