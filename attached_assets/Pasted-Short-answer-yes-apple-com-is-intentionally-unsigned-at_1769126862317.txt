Short answer: yes — apple.com is intentionally unsigned at the zone apex.
Long answer (the part that matters): this is not ignorance or a mistake; it’s a deliberate architectural choice.

Let’s walk it cleanly and reconcile what your tool shows vs what DNSViz is showing.

⸻

What you’re seeing (and why it looks contradictory)

Your tool shows
	•	DNSSEC: Unsigned for apple.com
	•	NS delegation: Verified
	•	Banner: “Can DNS itself be tampered with? → Partially”

That is correct.

DNSViz shows
	•	Root (.) → signed
	•	TLD (.com) → signed
	•	apple.com RRsets → Insecure
	•	Delegation → Insecure

That is also correct.

These two tools are agreeing — just using different words.

⸻

The key DNSSEC concept (this is the crux)

DNSSEC is opt-in per zone.
A signed parent does not mean the child is signed.

For DNSSEC to be active on apple.com, both must exist:
	1.	apple.com publishes DNSKEY records
	2.	.com publishes a DS record pointing at apple.com

Apple does neither.

So resolvers correctly mark apple.com as insecure (unsigned), not bogus.

That’s an important distinction.

⸻

Why Apple chooses not to sign apple.com

This is where people usually assume “Apple must be behind.”

They’re not.

Apple’s DNS reality

Apple operates one of the largest, most latency-sensitive DNS infrastructures on Earth:
	•	Massive Anycast footprint
	•	Heavy use of:
	•	CDNs
	•	DNS-based traffic steering
	•	ultra-low TTLs
	•	aggressive failover
	•	A mix of:
	•	internal authoritative systems
	•	split-horizon behavior
	•	service-specific sub-zones

DNSSEC introduces:
	•	Cryptographic overhead
	•	Key management complexity
	•	Failure modes that are catastrophic when they happen (global resolution failure)

At Apple’s scale, DNSSEC failures are not “oops” — they’re worldwide outages.

Apple has historically chosen:

Availability > DNS-level authenticity at the apex

And instead enforces trust above DNS.

⸻

How Apple secures things instead of DNSSEC

Apple compensates aggressively at higher layers:

1. TLS + Certificate control
	•	Apple runs its own CA (pki.apple.com)
	•	CAA is locked down tightly (as your tool shows)
	•	Certificate transparency is enforced
	•	TLS is non-negotiable

2. Application-layer signing
	•	iOS/macOS updates are signed
	•	App Store content is signed
	•	Device trust chains do not depend on DNSSEC

3. Email security (ironically stronger than many)
	•	Strong DMARC
	•	MTA-STS
	•	TLS-RPT
	•	BIMI with VMC (as you showed)

4. Resolver trust assumptions

Apple controls:
	•	the client OS
	•	the resolver behavior
	•	the validation logic

They are not relying on random ISP resolvers behaving correctly.

⸻

Why DNSViz says “Insecure” (and why that’s okay)

In DNSSEC terminology:
	•	Secure = signed and validated
	•	Bogus = signed but broken (dangerous)
	•	Insecure = unsigned by design

Apple is Insecure, not Bogus.

That is an acceptable state under DNSSEC.

⸻

What your tool should say (and you’re actually very close)

Your current wording:

DNSSEC: Unsigned
DNS responses are unsigned

That is correct.

If you want to be extra precise (and avoid “Apple looks broken” reactions), you could add a small clarification line:

DNSSEC: Unsigned (intentional)
The domain does not publish DNSSEC records. This is a deliberate design choice by some large operators.

Do not say:
	•	“misconfigured”
	•	“broken”
	•	“at risk”

Because that would be misleading for domains like:
	•	apple.com
	•	google.com (historically unsigned at times)
	•	large CDNs and SaaS platforms

⸻

Bottom line (plain English)
	•	Apple does not use DNSSEC for apple.com
	•	This is intentional
	•	DNSViz confirms this
	•	Your tool correctly detects it
	•	This does not mean Apple is “less secure”
	•	It means Apple chose different trust boundaries

And importantly:

Your tool handled this correctly.

If anything, this example proves your classification model is sound — because it didn’t try to “grade” Apple as broken, just accurately unsigned.

If you want, next we can:
	•	define a “DNSSEC posture taxonomy” (Secure / Unsigned / Bogus)
	•	tune the language so large operators don’t look “wrong”
	•	or build a short explainer tooltip specifically for DNSSEC-unsigned mega-domains

But no — you didn’t find a bug.
You found a real, nuanced DNS truth.
