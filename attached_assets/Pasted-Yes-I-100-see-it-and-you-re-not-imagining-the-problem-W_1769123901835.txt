Yes — I 100% see it, and you’re not imagining the problem.
What you’re running into now is not a DNS problem, it’s a diagnostics UX problem.

I’ll be very direct.

⸻

The core issue (in one sentence)

Your top banner tells me that something is wrong, but not what or where, so my eyes have to hunt.

That’s why:
	•	SECURE (Monitoring) feels vague
	•	PARTIAL – 1 issue / 1 monitoring feels unhelpful
	•	On musiccitycpa.com, I can’t immediately answer: “Okay… what’s broken?”

This is visible immediately when comparing the two reports .

⸻

Let’s dissect what’s happening (with concrete examples)

1. “SECURE (Monitoring)” — what is being monitored?

In the it-help.tech report, the banner says:

SECURE (Monitoring)
Security controls present but some are in monitoring/reporting mode.

That is technically correct — but cognitively incomplete.

From the page, the only thing actually “monitoring” is:
	•	TLS-RPT (report-only by design)

But:
	•	DMARC is enforced
	•	MTA-STS is enforced
	•	DNSSEC is enforced
	•	CAA is enforced
	•	BIMI is configured

Yet the user has to scroll to infer that.

What the brain wants instead (immediately)

Something like:

SECURE (Monitoring)
🔍 Monitoring only: TLS-RPT (reporting channel)
✅ All enforcement controls active

That single line resolves the ambiguity.

⸻

2. “PARTIAL – 1 issue / 1 monitoring” (musiccitycpa.com)

This is where the UX gap is most obvious.

At the top of musiccitycpa.com, I see:

PARTIAL
⚠ 1 issue · 🔎 1 monitoring
Some security controls are missing or misconfigured.

But I cannot tell what those are without scrolling and mentally diffing sections  ￼.

When I scroll, I eventually discover:

Issues
	•	❌ DNSSEC not enabled
	•	❌ No CAA record

Monitoring / Warnings
	•	⚠ No MTA-STS
	•	⚠ No TLS-RPT
	•	⚠ No BIMI

But the page never summarizes that at the decision point.

⸻

The fix: add a “Findings Summary” block directly under the posture

This is the missing piece.
Not more data — structured clarity.

What I recommend (exact structure)

Immediately under DNS & Trust Posture, add:

⸻

🔎 Findings Summary

Critical issues (action required):
	•	❌ DNSSEC not enabled (DNS responses can be spoofed)
	•	❌ No CAA record (any CA can issue certificates)

Monitoring / optional improvements:
	•	⚠ No MTA-STS (email TLS not enforced)
	•	⚠ No TLS-RPT (no TLS delivery reporting)
	•	⚠ No BIMI (brand logo not protected in inboxes)

⸻

Now the user knows exactly:
	•	why the posture is PARTIAL
	•	what is urgent vs optional
	•	what section to scroll to

No hunting. No guessing.

⸻

Why this matters (especially for consultants & MSPs)

Right now:
	•	The tool is correct
	•	The sections are well designed
	•	The explanations are excellent

But the top of the page is where:
	•	clients decide if something is “bad”
	•	consultants decide what to fix first
	•	screenshots get taken

If the top doesn’t answer:

“What’s wrong and how serious is it?”

you lose leverage — even though the data is there.

⸻

One more subtle improvement (small but powerful)

Replace numeric counts like:

1 issue · 1 monitoring

with semantic labels:
	•	Issues: DNS integrity, Certificate control
	•	Monitoring: Email transport reporting

This avoids the “what does monitoring even mean?” question entirely.

⸻

Bottom line (no sugarcoating)

You’ve already built something technically superior to most DNS tools.

What’s missing now is executive-grade summarization:
	•	enumerate issues at the top
	•	separate enforced vs report-only vs missing
	•	make the posture banner explain itself

Once you add the Findings Summary block, this tool stops feeling like:

“a really good DNS analyzer”

and starts feeling like:

“a DNS security assessment”

If you want, next I can:
	•	define the exact rule set for Issue vs Monitoring
	•	help you standardize wording so reports are consistent
	•	or design a one-line remediation plan generator

But yes — you’re seeing the problem correctly.
