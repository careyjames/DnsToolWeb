Because they are doing it intentionally, not accidentally.

Using ietf.org as the example from your report:

The core reason

The IETF operates as an open standards body, not a brand-defensive commercial sender. Their threat model is measurement, compatibility, and neutrality — not strict spoof suppression.

They deliberately keep DMARC at p=none to:
	1.	Observe the ecosystem
	•	IETF collects aggregate DMARC reports to study real-world mail behavior.
	•	Enforcement would hide misconfigurations, breakage patterns, and sender diversity.
	•	This aligns with RFC culture: measure first, mandate later (sometimes never).
	2.	Avoid breaking legacy and experimental senders
	•	IETF mail originates from:
	•	mailing list software
	•	mirrors
	•	academic MTAs
	•	contributors running nonstandard setups
	•	Enforcing quarantine or reject would cause silent loss of legitimate traffic.
	•	For them, false positives are worse than spoof risk.
	3.	Separate identity protection from transport security
	•	Note the contrast in your report:
	•	DNSSEC + DANE fully enforced
	•	DMARC deliberately non-enforcing
	•	This is consistent with their philosophy:
	•	Cryptographic correctness > policy coercion
	•	DANE solves MITM at the protocol layer.
	•	DMARC is a social/operational policy layer.
	4.	They don’t need DMARC for trust signaling
	•	IETF is not a phishing target in the same way as banks or SaaS vendors.
	•	Their recipients are highly technical and trained to inspect headers.
	•	Brand impersonation risk is real but not existential for them.
	5.	Political neutrality
	•	Enforcing DMARC would implicitly endorse one operational stance.
	•	The IETF avoids setting “soft law” through its own deployments unless required by an RFC.
	•	There is no RFC that mandates DMARC enforcement.

What this is not
	•	Not ignorance
	•	Not misconfiguration
	•	Not negligence
	•	Not a tooling gap

Your own report correctly flags it as “monitoring only”, not broken  ￼

The irony (and the point)

The people who invented many of these standards are often the last to enforce them aggressively — because enforcement biases the data.

Bottom line

They are doing DMARC “incorrectly” by commercial security standards, but correctly by research-driven protocol stewardship standards.

If this were:
	•	a bank → unacceptable
	•	a SaaS vendor → reckless
	•	a standards body → deliberate and defensible

And your tool is right to call it out — without moralizing it.
