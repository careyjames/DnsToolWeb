Yes — Python is the right “best practice” choice for an app. Not because “Python > curl”, but because RDAP is just HTTPS + JSON, and you want a real HTTP client inside your program (timeouts, retries, redirects, caching, structured parsing, tests), not a shell-out. RDAP is explicitly designed as a RESTful web service over HTTP.  ￼

What you should tell Replit (technical reality)
	•	cURL is fine for debugging or a quick prototype, but shelling out to curl from Python is usually the wrong architecture:
	•	extra process spawn overhead
	•	harder error handling (exit codes, stderr parsing)
	•	quoting/escaping footguns
	•	security risk if any input ever touches the shell
	•	painful to unit test
	•	Use a native HTTP client: httpx (modern) or requests (ubiquitous). Either is correct.

The real RDAP pain point (and how to fix it)

Most “RDAP is hard” complaints are actually bootstrapping: figuring out which RDAP server to query for a given TLD.

Do it the standards way:
	1.	Bootstrap from IANA (authoritative mapping of TLD → RDAP base URL).  ￼
	2.	Cache that mapping (hours/days).
	3.	For a domain example.tld, pick the server for .tld, then query:
	•	/domain/example.tld
	4.	Handle:
	•	HTTP redirects (some servers redirect you to registrar/registry-specific endpoints)
	•	rate limits (429), backoff
	•	timeouts and retries
	•	“privacy-redacted” responses (expected; registrant contact data is often hidden)

RDAP vs WHOIS (pragmatic)

RDAP is the current direction and (for gTLD registration data under ICANN’s ecosystem) it’s the “definitive” path as WHOIS is being sunset in favor of RDAP.  ￼
So: RDAP first, WHOIS only as fallback if you explicitly want coverage for weird legacy corners.

Minimal recommendation
	•	Implement RDAP in Python with httpx/requests.
	•	Use IANA bootstrap + caching.
	•	Keep a WHOIS fallback only if you care about edge cases.
	•	In your tool UI: surface “RDAP source (registry/registrar)” + timestamps + notices, and treat missing registrant details as normal, not failure.
