You don’t. Google Workspace tenants cannot enable DANE/TLSA for their inbound mail. Full stop.

Here’s the precise reality, no marketing gloss.

⸻

What DANE actually requires (SMTP per RFC 6698 / RFC 7672)

For SMTP DANE, the receiving MTA must:
	1.	Terminate SMTP on port 25
	2.	Present a known, stable TLS certificate
	3.	Publish TLSA records for its MX hosts
	4.	Have DNSSEC enabled and validated

The TLSA records bind that exact certificate (or key) to DNS.

⸻

Why Google Workspace can’t do this for your domain

When you use Google Workspace:
	•	Your MX points to:

aspmx.l.google.com
alt1.aspmx.l.google.com
…


	•	Those MTAs are:
	•	Shared, multi-tenant
	•	Certificate-rotated by Google
	•	Not dedicated to your domain
	•	Google does not publish per-customer TLSA records
	•	Google does not allow customers to publish TLSA records for Google’s MX

➡️ You do not control the SMTP endpoint or its certificates
➡️ Therefore you cannot safely publish TLSA records
➡️ Therefore DANE inbound is impossible on Google Workspace

This is a hard architectural limitation, not a missing toggle.

⸻

What Google does support

1. Outbound DANE validation

Google Workspace will validate TLSA records when sending mail to other domains that publish DANE.

That is:
	•	Sender-side DANE support
	•	Transparent
	•	No admin setting
	•	Automatically enabled

So if you email a DANE-enabled domain, Google will honor it.

⸻

2. MTA-STS (policy-based, not cryptographic)

This you can and should enable.

Google fully supports:
	•	mta-sts.example.com
	•	HTTPS policy hosting
	•	._mta-sts.example.com TXT
	•	tlsrpt.example.com reporting

This protects against downgrade and opportunistic TLS stripping without requiring TLSA.

⸻

The only ways to actually deploy inbound DANE

Option A — Run your own MTA

You control:
	•	MX
	•	Certificates
	•	DNSSEC
	•	TLSA

Works with:
	•	Postfix
	•	Exim
	•	OpenSMTPD

This is the only way to get real SMTP DANE today.

⸻

Option B — Enterprise mail gateway that supports DANE

Some high-end gateways support:
	•	Dedicated MX
	•	Stable certs
	•	TLSA publishing

Still rare. Still complex.

⸻

Best-practice reality for Google Workspace domains

Do this instead (this is the correct 2026 posture):

Control	Status
DNSSEC	✅ Enable at registrar
SPF	✅
DKIM	✅
DMARC (p=quarantine or reject)	✅
MTA-STS (mode=enforce)	✅
TLS-RPT	✅
DANE inbound	❌ Not possible on Google Workspace
DANE outbound	✅ Automatic

Your earlier statement is directionally correct in theory — DANE + MTA-STS is ideal — but Google Workspace can only ever be half of that equation.

⸻

Bottom line
	•	There is no way to “turn on DANE” for inbound mail in Google Workspace
	•	Anyone claiming otherwise is confusing outbound validation with inbound TLSA publishing
	•	If you see “DANE not configured” on a Workspace domain, that is expected and correct

If you want, next step we can:
	•	Tune your MTA-STS policy to maximum strictness
	•	Make your DNS tool explicitly explain why DANE is impossible on Workspace (this would save users a lot of confusion)
	•	Add logic to flag “DANE impossible due to hosted MX” vs “DANE missing but deployable”

Just say the word.
