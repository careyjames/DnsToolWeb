# Direct push to GitHub via PAT — the agent's method for pushing DnsToolWeb
# Usage: bash scripts/git-push.sh
#
# The user can also push via the Git panel after running git-panel-reset.sh.
# NEVER push via GitHub API (createBlob/createTree/createCommit/updateRef).
# See SKILL.md "Repo Sync Law" for why.
#
# LOCK FILES: Smart classification — only push-blocking locks (index, HEAD,
# config, shallow) cause HARD STOP. Background locks (maintenance, refs/remotes)
# are logged as INFO and do NOT block the push.
#
# SYNC VERIFICATION uses git ls-remote (read-only) instead of git fetch,
# because the Replit platform blocks .git writes from the agent process tree.
# NOTE: .git/objects/maintenance.lock is EXPECTED to be present — it's
# Replit's background git maintenance, not a stale lock. It does NOT block push.
