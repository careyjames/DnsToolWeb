## Licensing Summary

| Tool | License | Commercial Use | Redistribution | Our Usage |
|------|---------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| **nmap** (v7.94) | NPSL v0.95 | End-user: Yes | OEM license required | End-user (shell out) |

| **whois** | GPL ([GNU inetutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/)) | Yes | Yes (source required) | Standard lookup |
| **dnsutils** (dig/delv) | ISC ([BIND license](https://www.isc.org/licenses/)) | Yes | Yes | Standard lookup |

### Compliance Status: GREEN

All tools are used as **end-user utilities** — we shell out to them and parse
their output. We do NOT redistribute, embed, or bundle any of these tools.
Under every license listed above, end-user invocation is explicitly permitted
for commercial purposes.

**Nmap-specific note**: The NPSL restricts *redistribution* in proprietary
products (requires OEM license). We are NOT redistributing nmap — it is
installed via Nix as a system package and invoked via `exec.Command`. This
is the "end user" use case, fully permitted per NPSL §2 and the
[annotated license](https://nmap.org/npsl/npsl-annotated.html).

**testssl.sh note**: GPLv2 requires source disclosure if we *distribute* the
modified software. We do not distribute testssl.sh — we invoke it as an
installed system tool. No source disclosure obligation applies.

## Nmap NSE Scripts — Category & Risk Classification

Each NSE script has an official category that determines its intrusiveness.
Our implementation only uses scripts appropriate for DNS security auditing
of domains the user has authorized for scanning.

| Script | Categories | Risk Level | What It Does |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| `dns-zone-transfer` | intrusive, discovery | **Intrusive** | Requests AXFR from authoritative NS — tests if zone data leaks |
| `dns-recursion` | default, safe | **Safe** | Checks if NS allows recursive queries (read-only) |
| `dns-nsid` | default, safe, discovery | **Safe** | Queries BIND version and server ID via CH TXT (read-only) |
| `dns-cache-snoop` | intrusive, discovery | **Intrusive** | Probes for cached DNS entries (non-recursive mode) |

### Intrusive Script Justification

**dns-zone-transfer**: Sending an AXFR request to an authoritative nameserver
is a standard security audit check. If the server is correctly configured, it
denies the transfer. If misconfigured, exposing the vulnerability to the domain
owner is the entire purpose of the audit. This is RFC-standard behavior
(RFC 5936 §6 — zone transfer access control).

**dns-cache-snoop**: We use the default `nonrecursive` mode only, which sends
a standard DNS query with the RD (Recursion Desired) bit cleared. This is a
read-only operation that does not pollute the cache. The `timed` mode (which
has cache pollution risk) is NOT used.

### Authorization Model & Scanning Scope

**Scope**: Scans target ONLY the authoritative nameservers (NS records)
for the domain the user submits. No third-party infrastructure is probed.
No recursive resolvers, no upstream providers, no unrelated hosts.

**Authorization**: The user initiates every scan by explicitly submitting a
domain via the web interface. By submitting a domain for analysis, the user
represents that they own or have authorization to audit that domain. This
is reinforced by:
1. **Terms of Use**: The platform's terms require users to have authorization
   for domains they scan (same model as Qualys SSL Labs, SecurityHeaders.com,
   MXToolbox, and other established scanning platforms).
2. **Authentication**: Google OAuth login provides user identity and
   accountability for every scan.
3. **Rate limiting**: 8 requests per 60 seconds prevents abuse.
4. **Logging**: All scans are logged with user identity for audit trail.

**Scanning behavior**: All NSE scripts send standard DNS protocol messages
to port 53 on the domain's own nameservers. Zone transfer (AXFR) is a
standard DNS operation that correctly-configured servers deny. No exploit
code is executed; no services are disrupted.
