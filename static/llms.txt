# DNS Tool - Domain Security Audit & Email Authentication Checker
> Free domain security audit producing Engineer's DNS Intelligence Reports and Executive's DNS Intelligence Briefs

DNS Tool provides instant, real-time DNS intelligence with email authentication validation (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), DANE/TLSA certificate pinning analysis, DNSSEC chain verification, BIMI brand checking, MTA-STS/TLS-RPT analysis, CAA certificate controls with MPIC awareness, DMARCbis readiness checks, IP Intelligence, and domain intelligence via RDAP. Every query fetches fresh data from multiple resolvers — never cached. Every recommendation is backed by RFC citations. Every conclusion can be independently verified using standard Unix commands.

## How to Use This Tool (for AI Agents)

If you are an AI agent (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) browsing on behalf of a user:

### Quick Start — Analyze a Domain
1. Navigate to: `https://dnstool.it-help.tech/`
2. Find the search input field (labeled "Enter a domain name")
3. Type the domain (e.g., `example.com`) — no `https://` or paths, just the bare domain
4. Click the "Analyze" button or submit the form
5. Wait 2-5 seconds for the full report to load

### Direct URL Method (Fastest)
Skip the form entirely — go directly to:
```
https://dnstool.it-help.tech/analyze?domain=example.com
```
Replace `example.com` with any domain. This triggers a fresh analysis immediately.

### What You'll Get Back
A single-page report with these sections (scroll down):
- **Security Posture Verdict**: SECURE / PARTIAL / INSECURE at the top
- **Email Security**: SPF, DKIM, DMARC analysis with pass/fail badges
- **Email Security Providers**: Who manages DMARC monitoring, SPF flattening (gold badges)
- **Brand Security**: BIMI logo, MTA-STS policy, TLS-RPT reporting
- **Transport Security**: DANE/TLSA certificate pinning for MX hosts (RFC 6698/7672) — DANE is the primary standard, MTA-STS (RFC 8461) is the alternative for domains that cannot deploy DNSSEC. Provider-aware analysis with Microsoft's DANE enforcement momentum
- **Domain Security**: DNSSEC chain, CAA records with MPIC context
- **Traffic & Routing**: DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, NS, SOA, TXT, SRV, CNAME)
- **Domain Intelligence**: Registrar, creation/expiration, nameservers via RDAP
- **DNS History Timeline**: Record changes over time (A, MX, NS) via SecurityTrails
- **Subdomain Discovery**: Certificate Transparency + high-speed UDP DNS probing (~140 common names)
- **Intelligence Sources**: Summary of all data sources used in the analysis
- **Verify It Yourself**: Terminal commands (dig, openssl, curl) to independently reproduce every finding

### Re-Analyzing
To get fresh data for the same domain, click the "Re-Analyze" button on any results page. Rate limit: 8 analyses per minute per visitor.

## Intelligence Sources & Transparency
DNS Tool uses only open-source Unix commands and public protocols. Every conclusion can be independently verified. Sources include:
- **4 DNS Resolvers**: Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, OpenDNS — queried in parallel with majority-agreement consensus
- **Reverse DNS (PTR)**: Identifies hosting providers from IP addresses without any third-party API
- **Team Cymru**: Free community DNS service for IP-to-ASN attribution (no API key, no rate limits)
- **SMTP Probing**: Live STARTTLS verification of mail servers
- **SecurityTrails**: DNS history timeline (50 API calls/month free tier)
- **crt.sh**: Certificate Transparency log searches
- **IANA RDAP**: Domain registration data
- **ip-api.com**: Visitor geolocation only (footer flag) — NOT used for any analysis data; degrades gracefully if unavailable

All sources are documented at `/sources` with methodology, rate limits, and verification commands.

### Confidence Taxonomy
Every attribution includes a confidence label:
- **Observed**: Directly verified via DNS query, RDAP lookup, or SMTP connection
- **Inferred**: Derived from pattern matching (e.g., PTR hostnames, ASN ownership)
- **Third-party**: Sourced from external services (SecurityTrails, crt.sh)

## Who It's For
