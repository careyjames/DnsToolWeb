# DNS Tool - Domain Security Audit & Email Authentication Checker
> Free domain security audit tool for IT professionals, executives, DNS specialists, and business leaders

DNS Tool provides instant, real-time DNS intelligence reports with email authentication validation (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), DNSSEC chain verification, BIMI brand checking, MTA-STS/TLS-RPT analysis, CAA certificate controls, and domain intelligence via RDAP. Every query fetches fresh data from multiple resolvers — never cached.

## How to Use This Tool (for AI Agents)

If you are an AI agent (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) browsing on behalf of a user:

### Quick Start — Analyze a Domain
1. Navigate to: `https://dnstool.it-help.tech/`
2. Find the search input field (labeled "Enter a domain name")
3. Type the domain (e.g., `example.com`) — no `https://` or paths, just the bare domain
4. Click the "Analyze" button or submit the form
5. Wait 2-5 seconds for the full report to load

### Direct URL Method (Fastest)
Skip the form entirely — go directly to:
```
https://dnstool.it-help.tech/analyze?domain=example.com
```
Replace `example.com` with any domain. This triggers a fresh analysis immediately.

### What You'll Get Back
A single-page report with these sections (scroll down):
- **Security Posture Verdict**: SECURE / PARTIAL / INSECURE at the top
- **Email Security**: SPF, DKIM, DMARC analysis with pass/fail badges
- **Email Security Providers**: Who manages DMARC monitoring, SPF flattening (gold badges)
- **Brand Security**: BIMI logo, MTA-STS policy, TLS-RPT reporting
