# DNS Tool — Domain Security Intelligence
# https://dnstool.it-help.tech
#
# Philosophy: Open intelligence benefits everyone.
# Reports cite RFCs, use open standards, and are independently verifiable.
#
# AI Policy: We permit AI crawling, training, and inference on all content.
# We intentionally do NOT use Content-Usage or Content-Signal directives
# because neither is a ratified standard yet (Content-Usage is an active
# IETF working group draft; Content-Signal is Cloudflare proprietary).
# When a standard is ratified, we will adopt it immediately.
# Our AI Surface Scanner detects these directives on scanned domains.
#
# Per RFC 9309: User-agent: * with Allow: / welcomes all crawlers.
# No bot-specific blocks needed — the wildcard covers everyone.
