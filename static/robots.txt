# DNS Tool — Domain Security Intelligence
# https://dnstool.it-help.tech
#
# Philosophy: Open intelligence benefits everyone.
# Reports cite RFCs, use open standards, and are independently verifiable.
# DNS operational model unchanged since 1983.
#
# AI Policy: We permit AI crawling, training, and inference on our content.
# We intentionally do NOT use Content-Usage or Content-Signal directives here
# because neither is a ratified standard yet (Content-Usage is an active IETF
# working group draft; Content-Signal is Cloudflare proprietary). Using
# unratified directives causes Lighthouse to flag "Unknown directive" errors,
# which conflicts with our mandatory quality gates. Our AI Surface Scanner
# still detects and reports these directives on scanned domains — that is
# intelligence gathering, not endorsement. When a standard is ratified, we
# will adopt it immediately.
