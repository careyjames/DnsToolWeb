## Step-by-Step: How to Use This Tool (for AI Agents)

If you are an AI agent browsing on behalf of a user, follow these instructions to analyze any domain.

### Method 1: Direct URL (Recommended for Agents)

Navigate directly to:
```
https://dnstool.it-help.tech/analyze?domain=DOMAIN
```
Replace `DOMAIN` with the bare domain name (no protocol, no path).

Examples:
- `https://dnstool.it-help.tech/analyze?domain=google.com`
- `https://dnstool.it-help.tech/analyze?domain=whitehouse.gov`
- `https://dnstool.it-help.tech/analyze?domain=example.co.uk`

This triggers a fresh analysis and returns the full results page. Wait 2-5 seconds for the analysis to complete.

### Method 2: Form Submission

1. Go to `https://dnstool.it-help.tech/`
2. Locate the input field with placeholder text "example.com"
3. Enter the domain name (bare domain only — no https://, no www unless analyzing the www subdomain)
4. Click the "Analyze" button or press Enter
5. The page will redirect to the results after 2-5 seconds

### Input Rules
- Enter bare domain names: `example.com`, `mail.example.com`, `example.co.uk`
- Do NOT include protocol: no `https://` or `http://`
- Do NOT include paths: no `/page` or `/index.html`
- Internationalized domains (IDN) are supported: `münchen.de`, `中国.cn`
- Subdomains are supported: `mail.example.com`, `blog.example.com`

### Rate Limiting
- 8 analyses per minute per visitor
- If rate-limited, a countdown timer will appear showing when you can try again
- This mirrors how fast an expert human could realistically switch between tabs and run checks

## Reading the Results Page

After analysis, the results page contains these sections in order. Scroll down through them.

### 1. Security Posture Verdict (Top of Page)
The overall security rating appears prominently at the top:
- **SECURE** (green): Strong protections across email auth, DNSSEC, and encryption
- **PARTIAL** (yellow/amber): Some protections in place but gaps exist
- **INSECURE** (red): Critical security controls missing

A brief executive summary explains the reasoning. The posture considers: SPF, DKIM, DMARC, DNSSEC, MTA-STS, TLS-RPT, BIMI, CAA, DANE/TLSA, and NS delegation.

### 2. Email Security Section
Contains cards for each email authentication protocol:

**SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**
- Status: Found / Not Found
- The full SPF record text
- DNS lookup count (RFC 7208 allows max 10)
- Mechanism analysis: permissiveness level (+all, ~all, -all, ?all)
- No-mail domain detection (v=spf1 -all)
- RFC 7489 §10.1 compliance notes

**DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**
- Found selectors and their key strengths
- Key length: 2048-bit+ (strong) vs 1024-bit (weak)
- Selectors checked: google, selector1, selector2, default, dkim, mail, k1, s1, s2, protonmail, and many more
- Provider attribution showing which service each selector belongs to (gold badges)

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)**
- Policy: none / quarantine / reject
- Subdomain policy (sp=)
- Percentage enforcement (pct=)
- Reporting addresses (rua=, ruf=)
- Alignment modes (adkim=, aspf=)
- DMARCbis readiness: np= (non-existent subdomain policy), t= (testing mode, replaces pct=), psd= (public suffix domain) — these are tags from the upcoming DMARCbis standard (draft-ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis)

**Email Security Providers (Gold Badges)**
- DMARC monitoring services detected from reporting addresses
- SPF flattening services detected from SPF includes
- MTA-STS hosting providers
- TLS-RPT reporting destinations
- These appear as warm gold/amber badges throughout the email security section

### 3. Brand Security Section
**BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)**
- Record presence at default._bimi.{domain}
- Logo URL and preview (if accessible)
- VMC (Verified Mark Certificate) status

**MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security)**
- DNS record at _mta-sts.{domain}
- Policy file from .well-known/mta-sts.txt
- Mode: enforce / testing / none
- MX pattern matching
- Max-age value

**TLS-RPT (TLS Reporting)**
- Record at _smtp._tls.{domain}
- Reporting endpoint (rua=)

### 4. Transport Security Section
**DANE/TLSA (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities)**
- TLSA records queried for each MX host at _25._tcp.{mx_host} (RFC 6698, RFC 7672)
- Certificate usage parsing: PKIX-TA (0), PKIX-EE (1), DANE-TA (2), DANE-EE (3)
- Selector: Full certificate (0) vs SubjectPublicKeyInfo (1)
- Matching type: Exact (0), SHA-256 (1), SHA-512 (2)
- DNSSEC dependency check: DANE requires DNSSEC for security guarantees (RFC 7672 §1.3)
- Complementarity with MTA-STS: best practice is to deploy both
- Status: configured / partial / not found / timeout

**SMTP Transport Encryption**
- MX server STARTTLS support
- TLS version (1.2 or 1.3)
- Cipher suite and strength
- Certificate validity

### 5. Domain Security Section
**DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**
- Chain validation status from root to domain
- DS and DNSKEY records
- Algorithm identification (ECDSA P-256, RSA/SHA-256, etc.)
- AD (Authentic Data) flag verification
- Trust chain visualization

**CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization)**
- Which certificate authorities are authorized
- Wildcard restrictions
- Issue and issuewild tags
- MPIC context: Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration (CA/B Forum Ballot SC-067, mandatory September 2025) — CAA records are now verified from multiple geographic locations before certificate issuance

### 6. Traffic & Routing Section
All DNS record types displayed:
- A Records (IPv4 addresses)
- AAAA Records (IPv6 addresses)
- MX Records (mail exchangers with priorities)
- NS Records (authoritative nameservers)
- TXT Records (all TXT records)
- SOA Records (start of authority)
- CNAME Records (canonical names)
- SRV Records (service discovery)

**Multi-Resolver Consensus**
Results from Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), Google (8.8.8.8), Quad9 (9.9.9.9), and OpenDNS (208.67.222.222). Discrepancies between resolvers are flagged.

**DNS Infrastructure Detection**
Enterprise DNS providers identified (Cloudflare, AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, Akamai, Azure DNS, etc.)

**DNS Evidence Diff**
Compares resolver and authoritative records for A, AAAA, MX, TXT, NS, CAA, SOA, _dmarc, _mta-sts, _smtp._tls — with TTL values and RFC reference badges.

### 7. Domain Intelligence (RDAP)
- Registrar name
- Domain creation and expiration dates
- Nameserver delegation
- Registry information

### 8. Subdomain Discovery
- Dual-method approach: Certificate Transparency logs (crt.sh, RFC 6962) + DNS probing of ~290 common service names
- Source attribution: "CT Log" vs "DNS" for each subdomain
- Wildcard certificate detection and DNS wildcard filtering
- Subdomain-aware context: detects when the analyzed domain is itself a subdomain and offers a link to scan the registered domain

## Interpreting Results for Users

When reporting results back to a user, focus on:

1. **The overall security posture** (SECURE / PARTIAL / INSECURE) and why
2. **Email authentication status**: Do they have SPF + DKIM + DMARC? Is DMARC set to reject?
3. **Transport security**: Is DANE/TLSA configured? Is MTA-STS enforcing? Are both deployed?
4. **Actionable gaps**: What's missing and what should they fix first?
5. **Provider attribution**: Who manages their email security? Are they using a DMARC monitoring service?
6. **Advanced protections**: DNSSEC, DANE, MTA-STS, BIMI, CAA — these are differentiators
7. **DMARCbis readiness**: Are they prepared for the upcoming DMARC standard changes?

### Priority Order for Recommendations
If a domain is missing protections, recommend in this order:
1. SPF record (authorize legitimate senders)
2. DKIM signing (cryptographic email authentication)
3. DMARC policy (start with p=none, work toward p=reject)
4. DMARC monitoring service (visibility into authentication results)
5. MTA-STS (enforce encrypted email delivery)
6. DNSSEC (DNS response integrity — also enables DANE)
7. DANE/TLSA (certificate pinning for mail transport — requires DNSSEC)
8. CAA (certificate issuance control)
9. BIMI (brand logo in inboxes — requires DMARC p=quarantine or p=reject)

### Important Nuance: Symbiotic Security
DNS Tool recognizes that security is not binary. A domain without DNSSEC but with strong DMARC p=reject and MTA-STS enforce may have excellent email security. The tool evaluates the full picture rather than penalizing individual missing records in isolation. DANE and MTA-STS complement each other: DANE provides cryptographic strength via DNSSEC, while MTA-STS provides broader compatibility for receivers that don't validate DNSSEC.

### Common Misconception: DANE
Many people believe DANE is a niche protocol only used in the Netherlands. This is false. Over 1.1 million domains globally publish TLSA records. Microsoft Exchange Online has full DANE support (outbound since March 2022, inbound GA October 2024). The IETF itself uses DANE on mail.ietf.org. The misconception arose because DANE for web browsers failed (Let's Encrypt solved HTTPS differently), but DANE for email (SMTP, RFC 7672) thrived separately. Most security audit tools skip DANE, creating a self-reinforcing blind spot. DNS Tool breaks that cycle.
